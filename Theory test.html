<p style="color:cornflowerblue;">A theory test consists of two sections a hazard perception test and a theory test</p>
<p style="color:cornflowerblue;">A hazard perception is 14 video clips which are one minute long and there would be 15 hazards to find</p>
<p style="color:cornflowerblue;">Below are a few tips on passing first time</p>
<h3 style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">Take a few driving lessons before hand</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">By taking a few driving lessons you will get knowledge of road signs and basic road rules</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">Your driving instructor would usually explain basic hazards on the roads and this would benefit you as this would be covered in the test </p>
<h3 style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">Buy the theory test app </h3>
<img src="/Users/mac/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Documents/html stuff/launch.json/Unknown-5.jpeg"></a>
<p style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">This app would benefit you a lot because it is only 5 pounds but this covers everything you need</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">This app also has mock videos for the hazard perception which is also part of the theory test </p>
<h3 style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">Revise the hazard perception tests</h3>
<p style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">There are 14 clips that are selected randomly but it is important to revise all the videos becase you dont know which video you will get</p>
<p style="color:rgb(40, 109, 236);">It is also important for you not to click in a pattern or spam click as this will make it seem like you are cheating</p>
